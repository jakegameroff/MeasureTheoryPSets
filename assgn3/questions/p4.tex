\section*{Problem 4}
\noindent \textbf{4.} Let \( (A_\alpha)_{\alpha \in \mathbb{R}}  \) be a family of measurable subsets of \( \mathbb{R}^{d}  \) such that \[\bigcup_{\alpha \in \mathbb{R}}^{} A_\alpha = \mathbb{R}^{d} , \ \bigcap_{\alpha \in \mathbb{R}}^{} A_{\alpha} = \emptyset \ \mbox{and } (\forall \alpha, \beta \in \mathbb{R} : \alpha < \beta \implies A_\alpha \subseteq A_\beta).\] Find a measurable function \( f : \mathbb{R}^{d} \to \mathbb{R} \) such that \( f \leq \alpha \) on \( A_\alpha \) and \( f \geq \alpha \) on \( \mathbb{R}^{d} \setminus A_\alpha \) for each \( \alpha \in \mathbb{R} \).
\begin{proof}
	Define \( f : \mathbb{R}^{d} \to \mathbb{R} \) by \( x \xmapsto{f} \inf \{ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} : x \in A_\alpha \}  \).

	First note that since infima are unique, for each \( x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}  \) there exists a unique \( \mu \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( f(x) = \mu \). To see why \( -\infty < \mu < \infty \), note that \( \{ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} : x \in A_\alpha \}  \) is bounded below. Indeed, since \( \bigcup_{\alpha \in \mathbb{R}}^{} A_\alpha = \mathbb{R}^{d} \), for each \( x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}  \) there exists an \( \alpha \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( x \in A_{\alpha}  \). Then for each \( \alpha' \geq \alpha \), \( x \in A_{\alpha'}  \) since \( A_\alpha \subseteq A_{\alpha'}  \). But since \( \bigcap_{\alpha \in \mathbb{R}}^{} A_\alpha = \emptyset \), there must be a \( \lambda < \alpha \) such that \( x \notin A_{\lambda}  \), as otherwise the intersection would contain \( x \). To this end, for \( \lambda' < \lambda \), \( x \notin A_{\lambda'} \subseteq A_\lambda  \) so that \( \lambda \) is a lower bound for \( \{ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} : x \in A_\alpha \}  \). Hence, we conclude that \( \inf \{ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} : x \in A_\alpha \}  \) is a finite number, since we are taking the infimum over a bounded-below subset of \( \mathbb{R} \). 

	Let \( \alpha \in \mathbb{R} \) and \( x \in A_\alpha \) be fixed. Let \( S \coloneqq \{ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} : x \in A_\alpha \}  \) and \( \mu \coloneqq \inf S = f(x). \) By definition of the infimum, since \( \alpha \in S \), we have \( \mu \leq \alpha \), since \( \mu \) is a lower bound for \( S \). Therefore, \( f(x) = \mu \leq \alpha \). Since \( \alpha \) and \( x \) were arbitrary, we deduce that \( f \leq \alpha \) in \( A_\alpha \) for each \( \alpha \in \mathbb{R} \).

	Now suppose \( w \in \mathbb{R}^{d} \setminus A_\alpha \), with \( \rho \coloneqq f(w) = \inf \{ \alpha \in \mathbb{R} : w \in A_\alpha \} \). By definition of the infimum, for each \( \varepsilon  > 0 \) there exists a \( \rho ' \in \mathbb{R} \) such that \( w \in A_{\rho '}  \) and \( \rho' < \rho + \varepsilon \). Since \( w \in A_{\rho'}\), we must have that \( \alpha < \rho ' \), as otherwise \(w \in  A_{\rho'} \subseteq A_{\alpha}   \) so that \( w \in A_\alpha \) and \( w \in \mathbb{R}^{d} \setminus A_\alpha \), a contradiction. But then we have \( \alpha < \rho' < \rho + \varepsilon = f(w) + \varepsilon   \); and since \(\alpha, w, \mbox{and } \varepsilon  \) were arbitrary, we conclude that \( f \geq \alpha \) on \( \mathbb{R}^{d} \setminus A_\alpha \) for each \( \alpha \in \mathbb{R}\).

	It remains to be shown that \( f \) is measurable. Let \( c \in \mathbb{R} \) be fixed. Then \[ f^{-1}([-\infty, c]) =  f^{-1}((-\infty, c]) = \{ x \in \mathbb{R}^{d}  : f(x) \leq c \} = A_c \] by construction and since \( f \) only takes finite values. But \( A_c \) is measurable by hypothesis, thus \( f^{-1}([-\infty, c])  \) is measurable. Since \( c \) was arbitrary, we conclude that \( f \) is measurable with the desired properties, thereby completing the proof.
